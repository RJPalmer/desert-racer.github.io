# Desert Racer: Code Edition (2024)

Designed by Nitin Yadav

## Project Overview

Desert Racer: Code Edition is a lightweight, browser-based car racing game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It is designed as both a playable game and an educational resource to demonstrate basic game programming concepts: game loop, input handling, collision detection, level progression, asset loading (audio/images), and simple state management.

Key goals:
- Provide an accessible learning example for beginner-to-intermediate JavaScript developers.
- Offer a simple, fun game: collect coins, avoid obstacles, and advance through increasingly difficult levels.
- Be easy to run locally without build tools.

Features
- Smooth car controls (keyboard + on-screen controls for mobile)
- Coin collection and level progression
- Obstacles (plants, camels) with collision detection
- Background music and SFX (coin, crash)
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile

## Installation & Setup

Requirements
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Git (optional, for cloning)
- macOS Terminal or any terminal for running a simple static server (optional)

Clone the repository
Open Terminal (Mac) and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/desert-racer-code-edition.git
cd desert-racer-code-edition
```

Open directly in the browser
- Double-click `index.html` in Finder, or from Terminal:
```bash
open index.html
```

Serve via a local static server (recommended for consistent audio behavior)
- Python 3
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
open http://localhost:8000
```

Ensure audio files are present
Place the following files in the project root (or update paths in `game.js`):
- background.mp3
- coin.mp3
- crash.mp3

Project structure (typical)
- index.html — main game page
- styles.css — styling and responsive layout
- game.js — game logic (controls, collisions, audio)
- assets/ — images / screenshots / audio (optional)

## Usage

Controls
- Desktop: Arrow keys (Left / Right / Up / Down)
- Mobile: On-screen buttons (tap to move)
- Objective: Collect the required number of coins to progress. Avoid obstacles to prevent crashes.

Example playthrough
1. Open the game (index.html or via local server).
2. Accept the terms/instructions on the intro screen.
3. Use arrow keys to navigate the car and collect coins.
4. After collecting the required coins, the next level begins (difficulty increases).

## Development & Testing

- Edit code using VS Code (project available at: /Users/robertpalmer/Desktop copy/Coding/JavaScript/desert-racer.github.io)
- Recommended quick test: run the simple Python server above and open the game in the browser.
- Use the browser DevTools to inspect console logs, debug game loop and collision logic.

Optional enhancements you can add
- Unit tests for isolated logic (e.g., collision detection functions)
- Better asset management and preloaders
- Mobile UI/UX improvements and touch gestures
